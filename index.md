## Welcome to OP-Gen website

Here you can preview a couple of the examples our model has generated for both the movie and electronics domain:

### Example 1 - Movie

### Description: 
**A robot named Mother raises a baby girl from a test-tube embryo in a post-apocalyptic future. Years later, when the child has blossomed into a healthy teenager,  a wounded woman disrupts their idyllic coexistence with a damning counter-narrative of humanity's fate.**

#### Review generated:
This is one of those rare movies which remind us that simple, peaceful coexistence of humans of many nations, while natural and craved by most of us, is in current reality only a profound dream. The actors aren't bad and the plot moves along as steady as the Cyborg's metal feet.The ending may seem over-simplified I actually found it to hold deeper meaning as well as an interesting commentary on humanity in general.

### Example 2 - Electronics

### Description: 
**Apple iPod Touch: The iPod Touch has a 4-Inch Retina display. Your favorite music, gaming, and AR apps in your pocket. A10 Fusion chip for up to 2x faster performance, Up to 3x faster graphics. Group FaceTime with family and friends. Connect using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth**

The Apple iPod Touch is beautiful and video is simply amazing to watch on the Touch. The basic capabilities of multi-touch are very intuitive and the rest you already know if you've ever watched a commercial for iPod touch. The screen is gorgeous, with vibrant colors,and it is big enough to see what you're doing. The camera is decent, though still not truly Apple iPod touch quality, it is still better than most phones or WebCams I've had.
