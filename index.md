## Welcome to OP-Gen website

Here you can preview a couple of the examples our model has generated for both the movie and electronics domain:

### Example 1 - Movie

### Description: A robot named Mother raises a baby girl from a test-tube embryo in a post-apocalyptic future. Years later, when the child has blossomed into a healthy teenager,  a wounded woman disrupts their idyllic coexistence with a damning counter-narrative of humanity's fate. 

#### Review generated: This is one of those rare movies which remind us that simple, peaceful coexistence of humans of many nations, while natural and craved by most of us, is in current reality only a profound dream. The actors aren't bad and the plot moves along as steady as the Cyborg's metal feet.The ending may seem over-simplified I actually found it to hold deeper meaning as well as an interesting commentary on humanity in general.
